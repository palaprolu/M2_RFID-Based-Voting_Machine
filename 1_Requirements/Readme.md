# Components:-

## ATMEGA32:
ATmega328 is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed. Perhaps the most common implementation of this chip is on the popular Arduino development platform, namely the Arduino Uno, Arduino Pro Mini and Arduino Nano models.

## powersupply(5v):
A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load.

## AVR ISP PROGRAMMER:
The Arduino ISP is an In-System-Programmer that is used to program AVR microcontrollers. You can use the Arduino ISP to upload sketches directly on the AVR-based Arduino boards without the need of the bootloader. Otherwise you can use it to restore the bootloader.

## JHD_162ALCD(16*2LCD):
This is 16 x 2 LCD Display with Yellow/Green Backlight ASCII Alphanumeric Character. 16×2 LCD Display Support mostly All Digital Microcontroller such as Arduino, 8051, PIC, AVR, ARM, MSP, COP8, STM, Raspberry Pi etc. About 16×2 LCD Display: 16×2 LCD is a basic 16 character by 2 line display Yellow/Green Back light.
The use of it is ,a 16x2 LCD display is very basic module and is very commonly used in various devices and circuits. A 16x2 LCD means it can display 16 characters per line and there are 2 such lines. In this LCD each character is displayed in 5x7 pixel matrix.

## 100uF capacitor:
The use of 100uF capacitor is  used in power regulation to smooth voltage fluctuations. This can also be used in sensor applications to remove noise in the signal.This should be connected across the power supply .

## Button:
The term button refers to any graphical control element that provides the user a simple way to trigger an event, like searching for a query at a search engine, or to interact with dialog boxes, like confirming an action. It should be taken five pieces .
## 10Kohm resistor:
These 10Kohm resistors are commonly used in breadboards and other prototyping applications, these 10K ohm resistors make excellent pull-ups, pull-downs and current limiters . It should be taken five peices .

## 100nF capacitor:
A good rule of thumb for digital circuits is to use a single 100nF ceramic capacitor for each logic integrated circuit, as well as a single larger electrolytic capacitor per board or circuit segment.
Five pieces should be taken .

## LED :
The high efficiency and directional nature of LEDs makes them ideal for many industrial uses. LEDs are increasingly common in street lights, parking garage lighting, walkway and other outdoor area lighting, refrigerated case lighting, modular lighting, and task lighting. Two LEDs must be taken .

## EM-18(RFID MODULE)
EM18 is a RFID reader which is used to read RFID tags of frequency 125 kHz. After reading tags, it transmits unique ID serially to the PC or microcontroller using UART communication or Wiegand format on respective pins. EM18 RFID reader reads the data from RFID tags which contains stored ID which is of 12 bytes.
