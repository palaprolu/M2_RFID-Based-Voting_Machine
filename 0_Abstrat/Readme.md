# RFID Based voting Machine

## Introduction:-

We know in offices, shopping malls and in many other places where only the person with authorization card is allowed to enter the room. These systems use RFID communication system. RFID is used in shopping malls to stop theft as the products are tagged with RFID chip and when a person leaves the building with the RFID chip an alarm is raised automatically. The RFID tag is designed as small as part of sand. The RFID authentication systems are easy to design and are cheap in cost. Some schools and colleges nowadays use RFID based attendance systems.
      
In this project we are going to design a voting machine which only counts authenticated votes. This is done by using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags.  Here we are going to write a program for ATMEGA for allowing only authorized RFID tag holders to vote.

Whenever we go to vote for elections we come to see electronic voting machines. In this project we are going to design and develop a simple voting machine by using ATmega32A microcontroller. Although we can use the controller to get more than 32 people voting machine, to keep everything simple we are going to make a voting system for a size of four people.We will have four buttons for four people and whenever a button is pressed, a vote goes for the corresponding person and the number of votes each person gets shown on LCD.
